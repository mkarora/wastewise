# Wastewise

An LLM powered application to help track and glean insights from your household food waste.

## Usage:
There are two pages in the application:
1. Save Entry: Log food that you have bought, received, or thrown out here
2. Monthly Insights: This will load LLM powered insights about your food waste over the last month

## Running the app:
This must be run on your local machine. Follow the instructions in the backend/README.md to get the server running, then the instructions in the frontend/README.md to launch the UI. Logs saved will be persisted in the backend/data/entries.json file.
